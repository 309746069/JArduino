Welcome to the JArduino project, powered by ThingML (www.THingml.org)!

Browse the dist folder to get the latest JArduino distribution, which you can import as an Eclipse project.

The ThingML/JArduino team.

Before using JArduino, please make sure your Arduino board contains the JArduino firmware:

1- Copy the JArduino folder (located in the distribution in org.sintef.jarduino.samples/arduino) into /libraries/

2- Launch your Arduino environment

3- File -> Examples -> JArduino -> JArduino firmware. It should open an Arduino program that you should upload to your board using the normal Arduino procedure.

4- Your Arduino board is now ready for Jarduino. You can exit the Arduino environment forever and launch Eclipse. Just run the Java/JArduino program.


To test samples using the current version of JArduino (requires Maven + the Arduino board connect on the serial port of the PC):

        $ git clone git@github.com:ffleurey/JArduino.git

	$ cd JArduino
	
	$ mvn clean install
	
	To run some examples without IDE
	
	$ cd jarduino.samples

	$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.sintef.jarduino.gui.JArduinoGUI"
	
	Replace "org.sintef.jarduino.gui.JArduinoGUI" with your own main class
